# Issue Tracker for the AWS Ansible Collection

This repository is the issue tracker for the
[AWS Ansible Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/steampunk/aws)
developed by our [XLAB Steampunk](https://steampunk.si/) team.

For user guides and references, please visit the
[collection documentation site](https://docs.steampunk.si/aws/).

## What can I find here?

The purpose of this repository is to track issues and feature requests
from the user community.

Did you encounter a problem when using the modules and plugins from the
collection? Or do you have a scenario that the collection currently
cannot tackle? You've come to the right place!


## Where is the source code?

While the free version of the AWS Ansible Collection is [available on
Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/steampunk/aws), it is not an
open-source project. We set up this repository because we'd still love
to hear from you.


## How can I contribute?

You can help us improve the collection by contributing bug reports and
ideas for future improvements. You can begin by:

1. Creating a new issue (_Issues -> New issue_),
2. Choosing the appropriate issue template (feature request or bug
   report), and
3. Filling in the issue template and submitting the issue.
